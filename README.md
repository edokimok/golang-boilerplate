# golang-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for starting a Golang project in Bazel. I use it for my personal Golang projects.

This contains two examples:

1. Hello world binary for just printing hello world
2. Hello world gRPC example with client/server

## How to use

```
bazel run //:gazelle
```

```
bazel build //...
```
