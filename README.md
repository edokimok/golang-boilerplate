# golang-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for starting a Go project in Bazel.

The main purpose of this project is to test Go support in the new Bazel plugin by JetBrains.

This contains two examples:

1. Hello world binary for just printing hello world
2. Hello world gRPC example with client/server
